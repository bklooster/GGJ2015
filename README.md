A bunch of people got togheter one day fated to make a game with total strangers.
One of them had an idea to make an educational game based on music and the strangers liked this very much.

The premise of the game will be like amplitude, rockband, etc and have notes come down a musical staff.
The user will then activate the notes and this will please the bear.
The bear will "dance" in relation to how well the user plays the notes.

This is Jinglebears.
